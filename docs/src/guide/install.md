## Build tool

### Gradle Project (Recommended)

::: details I don't know Gradle, how to start with it?
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool for multi-language software development. It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing. Gradle is similar to Apache Ant/Apache Maven in term of Java build tools.

First, let's install Gradle.

If you're on Mac, with [brew](https://brew.sh/) simply run:
```shell script
brew install gradle
mkdir newproject && cd newproject
gradle init
```

If you're on Windows, with [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) simple run:
```shell script
choco install gradle
mkdir newproject && cd newproject
gradle init
```

And then you have a Gradle build template with `build.gradle` file in your project directory `newproject`.
:::

`build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.jinyframework', name: 'core', version: '0.3.0'
}
```

### Maven Project

`pom.xml`

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jinyframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
